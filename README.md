Numerical analysis of the convergence behavior of adjoint-optimized neural PDEs.

Many engineering and scientific fields have recently become interested in modeling terms in partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. The resulting neural-network-PDE model, being a function of the neural network parameters, can be calibrated to available data by optimizing over the PDE using gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated in a computationally efficient manner by solving an adjoint PDE. These neural-network PDE models have emerged as an important research area in scientific machine learning.
